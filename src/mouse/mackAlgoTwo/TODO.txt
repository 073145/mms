- Add a history/reset button
- Optimization
    - 1 byte for the cell location
    - 1 byte for the cell walls
    - Other optimizations
- Kill unused imports
- Turn asserts off
- Test multiple maze sizes
- Const correctness
mazeIndex -> cell
- ColorTile -> colorCell

- Clear up confusion between mazeindex and heapindex
- mazeindex and heapIndex types
- Separate type for Direction too, all different types of byte values, make sure types can't mix...
