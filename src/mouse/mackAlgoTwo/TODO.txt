    - On each reset, just try to get to the center
    - Then after getting to center, potentially try:
        - The closest cell to you on the fastest path from the beginning to the center
        - The cell with the furthest distance from the start on the fastest path
        - Something else?
- Test multiple maze sizes
- Optimization
    - Const correctness
    - Kill unused imports
    - Turn asserts off
