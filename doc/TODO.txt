High Priority
=============
NONE

Medium Priority
===============
- Ensure that any file can be loaded regardless of maze size specification
- Figure out how to optimize the floodfill to find the quickest path
- Make terminal style output at bottom or right of window
- Display another window of the robot's perception
- Autogenerate makefile dependencies
- Make the shortest path look a little better

Low Priority
===============
- Make the mouse look prettier (draw black box around, or something)
- Handle the case when target tile is unreachable - it just crashes right now
- Ensure that all tiles are reachable in a randomly generated maze

Long Term
=========
- Make this a more realistic simulation by allowing angles, adding sensors, etc.
