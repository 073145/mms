High Priority
=============
- Maze files are not recognized when sim is run from the "bin" directory
- Ensure that any file can be loaded regardless of maze size specification
- Re-namespace all items in directories
- Edit README to instruct on proper use of algorithm

Medium Priority
===============
- Remove as much dependency on the parameter file as possible, other than in "main.cpp"
- Make Dijkstra's Algorithm to find shortest path and display it on the simulation
- Figure out how to optimize the floodfill to find the quickest path
- Make terminal style output at bottom or right of window
- Display another window of the robot's perception

Low Priority
===============
- Make the mouse look prettier (draw black box around, or something)
- Handle the case when target is unreachable - it just crashes right now

Long Term
=========
- Make this a more realistic simulation by allowing angles, sensors, etc.
