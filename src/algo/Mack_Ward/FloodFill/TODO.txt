- When solving the maze, reduce the number of turns that the mouse makes
- Pass things by reference when possible
- Optimize the lists of modified cells
- Make sure that the mouse doesn't edit the wall values for the perimeter of the maze
- Improve the explore method of the floodfill algorithm
    - This could be done by calculating both the distance to the center AND the
      distance to that square from the starting square - no need to travel to 
      far away squares
