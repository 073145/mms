# Summary

This is an application for developing and simulating Micromouse algorithms. For
information on the Micromouse competition, see the [Micromouse Wikipedia
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse)

# Motivation

Back when I was in IEEE at the University at Buffalo, as I'm sure is the case
now, we procrastinated on mostly all of our projects. This included Micromouse;
if it was more than a week before the competition, you could safely assume our
robot wasn't built yet. This proved to be problematic for the programmers on
the project. They weren't able to start writing code until way too late (read
"the night before the competition").

In an attempt to solve the problem of not being able to write and test code
before the robot was built, we built this simulator.

The simulator is also meant to be a teaching tool - to help those who may be
interested, but not familiar, with programming to take their first few baby
steps.
