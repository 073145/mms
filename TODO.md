    - how many steps
    - ave steps
    - etc.
- Make sure that the mouse fits in the starting square
- Algo checklist?
- Still view a maze if it fails validation, but don't let the sim continue...

    - Figure out how to make sensors more efficie
    - Make the sensor polygon model better

- Make a nice mechanism for writing our own maze generation algorithms
- Add Wheel max speed (specificed in mouse parameter file)
- Change over the Makefile to use cmake
- In discrete mode, the mouse can overturn or go too far if the sim speed is to high. We need to implement some logic that checks this ahead of time and then just teleports... sort of like bullets in other physics simulators
- Add trajectory lines (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgJClVCPu3w)
- Crash recovery semantics
- Draw a path of where the robot has been (the history object could be used for recording as well)

# Clean-Up

- write "isDirectory(std::string path)" and enforce this where necessary
- write getRandom() and replace old calls to rand()
- Performance on different systems???

- Replace "cout" with "LOG"
- Pass things by reference when possible
- Sprinkle assertions everywhere
- Validate the coding standards (especially "{" placement)

- Change the Mouse to use the technically correct position update implementation
- Clean up / improve the coding standards
- Fit code into 80/100 columns... use a linter for this

- Document the confusing coordinate systems
- for each loop iterations should use const references
