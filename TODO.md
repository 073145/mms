# High Priority

- Logging is too expensive
    - Causing freezing and crashing
    - Generalize a method for counting and logging few times, 1 per second
- Provide a direction to turnAround (left or right turns)
- Update algos to use stopOnTileEdge, update documentation for rightWallFollow, etc.

- Make a mechanism for easily merging the a discrete algo into a continuous one
    - Figure out how to bring the high level logic into the control algo
- Updates on the tile boundaries, not centers
    - Make this an option in the algo specification
- Make some video tutorials
- Write some code to make sure update throughput is good
    - 99% of updates are 1ms apart, or something like that
- Check the sleep duration of updates to make sure that we're actually doing 1000 updates per second
- Can we use mutable in the MouseInterface so declare wall on read is const? Make other methods in that class const?
- Other mouse movements - curve turns, j-turns, diagonals, etc.
    - Genericize the move forward so that we can do curve turns
    - The base case is when polygon sides n = 4, we have regular turns
- Add a way to time the algorithms
    - How long it took to get to the center of the maze
    - Make this faster than real time
        - Make sure consistent at all speeds
- Arbitrary tile text
    - Make a note about how to show actual distances
    - Make a note about text automatically wrapping (the actual tile distances do not do this)
- Make a voluntary Delay in setTileBaseColor, text
- Stepper motor
- Sensor type (digital or analog)
- Make some utility that keeps track of simulation and real elapsed time
    - Actually keep track of the elapsed simulation time
    - Max speeds for manual algorithm
    - Add the simulation time to the logging
        - Perhaps even refactor the elapsed time in logging
- Put a toolbar at the top or bottom with info
    - Check that a font exists, print error and die if not
    - Information of the wheel speeds
    - Display a clock (real and sim time)
    - Current layout
    - Speed in the x, y, and along the hypotenuse
    - Pretty much all state information

        - sim speed
        - Show toggle tile text, even when not visible
    - Check to make sure font won't be cut off, use ellipses if so (How do we deal with text being cut off in the vertical direction?)
    - Set the mouse algo in State for display in the toolbar
    - Make terminal style output at bottom or right of window (GUI)
- Make MouseInterface into an interface, and then implement the simulator interface, make a real-world interface
- Change float to units (including in the ParamParser and Param class)
- Type safety (in terms of units) of the parameters
- Look at Tomasz' maze website
- Figure out how to get rid of ifdefs in algorithm
- Make a SimInterface and make sure it's easy to "extract" an algorithm for use on Arduino

- Include Arduino "types" with the MouseInterface
- More Arduino function support
- Add gridlines (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGRutv9cGBA and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtnTBf5ItEc)
    - Variable width?
- Buffer communication (like with the real robot)
- Clang compiler support
- Number of unique cells traversed
- Make a separate process for algo, so if the algo dies the sim stays alive, and so that we can start an algo over really easily
- Continuous performance
    - CPU with megaMouse.xml
    - MinSleepDuration is a little bit weird - sometimes we try to sleep less than that
- Explain which options only work for discrete mode
    - Make a note about how to do params in algos
    - Talk about each of the parameters in documentation
- Discrete mode speed...
    - Ensure that the wheel speed is not too high in the MouseInterface (so that the mouse does not clip through walls)
    - In discrete mode, the mouse can overturn or go too far if the sim speed
      is to high. We need to implement some logic that checks this ahead of
      time and then just teleports... sort of like bullets in other physics
      simulators
- Make a note about symmetry with discrete interface
    - Make a formal check for symmetry

# Medum Priority

- Organize params in res/parameters.xml and Param.h/.cpp
- Improve sensor readings by getting the actual complete polygon, not apporximated
- For curve turns, see if you can figure out the arc that the mouse should go on to simulate a curve turn, use checkpoints
    - No curve turn has two line segments, each is tangent
        - first order curve turn has 3 line segments total, equally spaced, etc.

    - how many steps
    - ave steps
    - etc.
- Still view a maze if it fails validation, but don't let the sim continue...
- Testing for resource existence (like the shaders, font images, etc.)
- Add manual mode high scores

- Performance on different systems???
- The mouse sometimes rotates weirdly (goes slowly, backwards for a second, and then forwards fast. You can see what I mean by just increasing the view length of the sensors for a continuous algo)
- Remove as many c_str() as possible
- Replace "cout" with "L()"
- Pass things by reference when possible
- Sprinkle assertions everywhere
- Validate the coding standards (especially "{" placement)
