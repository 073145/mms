High Priority
=============
- Maze files are not recognized when sim is run from the "bin" directory
- Ensure that any file can be loaded regardless of maze size specification

Medium Priority
===============
- Make terminal style output at bottom or right of window
- Remove as much dependency on the parameter file as possible, other than in "main.cpp"
- Toggle on/off shortest path (write code to find shortest path)

Low Priority
===============
- Make the mouse look prettier (draw black box around, or something)

Long Term
=========
- Make this a more realistic simulation by allowing angles, sensors, etc.
