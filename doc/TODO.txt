High Priority
=============
- Collision Detection
- Parser classes for mouse and maze
- Synchronization documentation between the World, Graphics, and Mouse 
- Make Sensor and Motor abstract, support different types
- Change float to units (including in the ParamParser and Param class)
- Maze Validation (both physically valid mazes and competition valid mazes)

Medium Priority
===============
- Type safety (in terms of units) of the parameters
- Convert floats to doubles where appropriate
- Color class/object? Utility function for setting color? Drawer class?
- Change the colors of the wheels based on the speed of the wheels
- Show the direction that the robot is facing...
- Run the program with maximum thread priority
- New maze w/o restarting app
- Make a distinction between the mouse interface and sim interface
- Ensure that any file can be loaded regardless of maze size specification
- Make terminal style output at bottom or right of window
- Display another window of the robot's perception
- Shortest path graphic
- Rewrite the Makefile to use an "inc" directory
- XML file for algorithm choice
- Indicator of sim speed
- Support more than two wheels
- Sim code should match the bot code as closely as possible
- Dual screen! (mini-map and zoomed-in view - 1x1, 3x3, relative and absolute rotation)
- Reduce CPU usage - most is used by the drawing... cache some stuff??? Only redraw certain things???
- Instead of speeding up and slowing down the simulator (which is difficult because
  the Arduino code is already executing as fast as possible) we could take snapshots
  of the simulation, and then run the simulator from that particular point. This would
  involve providing some sort of snapshot interface to the algorithm.
- Move the unit classes to the src directory
- Make a wrapper function for a functions that sleep amout-duration
- Ensure that the mouse update is the continuous function
- Make sure that the coordinate frame of the robot is what we expect
- Handle bad values in the parameters, such as bad colors, negative values, etc.
- atoi -> strToInt

Low Priority
===============
- Use DIRECTIONS where possible
- Pass things by reference when possible
- Figure out how the discrete and continuous interfaces can coexist
- Sprinkle Assertions everywhere
- Make the mouse look prettier (draw black box around, or something)
- Handle the case when target tile is unreachable - it just crashes right now
- Validate the coding standards (especially "{" placement)
- Rewrite "i++" as "++i" or "i += 1"
